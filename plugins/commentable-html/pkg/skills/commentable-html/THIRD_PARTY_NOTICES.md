# Third-party notices

The commentable-html skill bundles a few third-party open-source libraries, redistributed
here under the MIT License: mermaid and Chart.js render diagrams and charts (vendored into
the built templates and inlined into zero-network Offline exports), and lz-string compresses
the stored comment data. Their upstream license texts are reproduced in full below, as the
MIT License requires. The skill's validator also adapts a small amount of code from CPython's
standard library, so the PSF License, its copyright notice and a summary of the changes are
reproduced below too, as that license requires.

## CPython (Lib/html/parser.py) 3.13

Changes made to Python: `tools/validate/checks/parsing.py` adapts the start-tag attribute
tokenizer (`tagfind_tolerant`, `attrfind_tolerant`) and the attribute-value character-reference
rule (`attr_charref`, `_replace_attr_charref`) from CPython 3.13's `Lib/html/parser.py`. They
are renamed (`_TAG_NAME_RE`, `_ATTR_RE`, `_ATTR_CHARREF_RE`, `_replace_attr_charref`), run over
the raw start tag rather than inside `HTMLParser.parse_starttag`, resolve named references
against a frozen copy of `html.entities.html5`, and return an oversized numeric reference
unchanged instead of raising. No other part of Python is redistributed.
