# Changelog

All notable changes to the `commentable-html` plugin are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Hardened build stamping so `dev/VERSION` updates `plugin.json`, the marketplace entry, generated files,
  and skill metadata consistently.
- Added CI coverage for version-bump checks and NonPortable output so shipped artifacts stay in sync with
  their sources.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-10

First official release.

### Added

- Offline, single-file commentable HTML review surface: reviewers select any paragraph, table cell,
  code block, KQL block, chart, image, or mermaid diagram and leave inline comments, then copy or
  export a bundle back to an agent, with no network dependency.
- Portable mode (one self-contained file) and NonPortable mode (companion CSS/JS files).
- Deterministic Python tooling (`new_document`, `inline_images`, `chart_block`, `upgrade`, `validate`,
  and more) plus a standard-library validator that enforces the structural invariants of a generated
  file.
- Rich, commentable content: tables, Chart.js charts, mermaid diagrams, KQL blocks, code-review diffs,
  and inlined images.
- Each generated file stamps the skill version that produced it in a
  `<meta name="commentable-html-version">` in the head and in the visible footer.

### Notes

- The injected layer is version-agnostic: the region markers, the companion filenames, and the demo
  storage keys no longer embed a version. The single source of truth for the release version is
  `dev/VERSION`; `build.py` stamps it into the layer constant, `plugin.json`, the marketplace entry,
  and each document's version `<meta>`, and `build.py --check` guards against drift.
